<p><p>The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) repair market primarily comprises two graft types: autografts and allografts. Autografts involve using the patient's own tissue, typically harvested from the hamstring or patellar tendon, providing excellent biological compatibility and lower rejection rates. Allografts, on the other hand, utilize donor tissue, offering a quicker surgical process and less postoperative pain for the patient, but may carry a higher risk of immune response or disease transmission. Both options cater to differing patient needs and surgeon preferences.</p></p>
